# COSC302-LabA
Letter-Dice network flow problem using Edmonds-Karp's algorithm

# worddice.cpp
This file uses a graph structure to solve a network flow problem. The user inputs 2 
text files; one for the dice and one for the words. The dice text file contains a list 
of strings. The length of the string determines how many sides the die has and the 
characters are the letters on each side of the die.
